# Solution Description 
The solution connect to an STOMP broker (e.g. Apache ActiveMQ Artemis) over a WebSocket using "@stomp/stompjs" to retrieve weather information. 
It allows the user to retrieve and render realtime weather information published by one sensor and allows the user to switch on or off the data stream. 

It uses the following libraries: 
1. Rect libraries for rendering and controlling the application 
2. stomp/stompjs for interconnecting with the backend broker over STOMP
3. FusionCharts (https://www.fusioncharts.com) for rendering the charts 

The application subscribes to the topic: 'iot_publisher' to get the weather data and publishes the switch-on or -off command to the topic: 'iot_commands'

Three scripts are used: 
1. App.js is the main script to render only two components 
2. RenderSensorData.js is to subscribe to the 'iot_publisher' and to render the weather data
3. Publisher.js is to publish switch on or off commands through the 'iot_commands'

The application communicate to 'ws://localhost:61614/stomp', where the Apache ActiveMq Artemis should run. Therefore, sensor data shall be available for streaming and the sensor shall subscribe to the iot_commands in order to react. 

## Relevant projects and tools
1. ActiveMq Artemis with support/activate of the STOMP protocol (https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/)
2. The Java IoT-Solution application that simulates the weather sensor


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
